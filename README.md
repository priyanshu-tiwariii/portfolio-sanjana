# Sanjana Bishnoi – Designer Portfolio

This is a fully custom-designed and developed portfolio website for **Sanjana Bishnoi**, the designer of my team. Every section, layout decision, interaction, and animation was carefully crafted by me **Priyanshu Tiwari** to reflect a minimal, high-end, and handcrafted digital presence that showcases her work with clarity and personality.

Unlike generic portfolio templates, this project was imagined, structured, and built entirely from scratch — with the intent to stand out as a branded experience rather than a resume on the web.

## Project Overview

The portfolio includes **three thoughtfully structured pages**, each with a distinct purpose and a consistent aesthetic tone:

- **Home (Landing) Page**  
  A clean hero section introducing Sanjana with visual design elements that reflect her personality and skill.

- **About Page**  
  A deeper dive into her background, design education, values, and approach — structured to build trust and identity.

- **Work Page**  
  A grid-style showcase of handpicked projects, using hover interactions, subtle animations, and responsive layout to give her work the space and elegance it deserves.

Every component and interaction was designed to enhance visual clarity and reduce cognitive load — without compromising creativity.
